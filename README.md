Graphene is a nano-scale knowledge graph publishing, management, and analysis framework. Check back soon for more details.

# Nano-scale?

Nano-scale knowledge graphs are built of many *[nanopublications](http://nanopub.org)*, where each nanopublication is tracked individually, with the ability to provide provenance-based justifications and publication credit for each tiny bit of knowledge in the graph.
